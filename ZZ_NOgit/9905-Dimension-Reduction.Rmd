<!-- # Small Scale - Part 2: Dimension Reduction (incomplete) -->

<!-- Here we will compare different dimension reduction techniques on 6 different stations. -->

<!-- ## Sparse Polynomials -->

<!-- We have been explained and showed that with the polynomial features we've gained a more in depth perspective. However this approach increases dimensions by a lot, so we may omit some of these polynomial features: -->

<!-- For example the "combination" of non-neighboring locations may be ignored. So, let's create a sparse polynomial maker function. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- dlevel_order <- factor(dresults2$model, level = unique(dresults2$model)) -->
<!-- plotx = ggplot(dresults2) + -->
<!--     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dlevel_order, y = train_error, color = station)) + -->
<!--     labs(x = "Models", y = "Mean Absolute Error", title = "Final Results", subtitle = "Error Comparison") -->
<!-- print(plotx) -->

<!-- ``` -->
